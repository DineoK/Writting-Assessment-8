<h2>8. Your future: the good parts</h2>
<p>Something I enjoy doing is imagining where I would be in the next 10 or 5 years. I see myself with qualifications and in a stable job while still trying to improve my coding skill and stay relevant in the workplace. At that point kids, would not be a thought on my mind. I see my future self traveling, meeting all sorts of wonderful people in the career I would like to pursue in, which is coding. I envision myself painting big art murals and living a life where I can sit at a caf√© and do my work.</P>
